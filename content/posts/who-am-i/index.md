I was born in Ibaraki Prefecture and spent time in high school.

I moved to Chiba prefecture when I entered university, and after graduating from university, I live in Tokyo.

I majored in global environmental science at university.

I became interested in IT when I learned that IT is useful for solving global environmental problems.

The first programming language I learned was C, which I learned in a university class.

After that, I studied Ruby, and in my graduation research, I created an environmental household account book application as a web application with Ruby on Rails, and studied the effect of that application on environmentally conscious behavior.

After graduating from university, I joined a system integration company, but I wanted to become a DevOps engineer for a service provider in the future, so I changed jobs at the beginning of the second year.

Currently, I am mainly working on service maintenance and development at a Real Estate Tech company.

I spend my holidays growing grass on Github, watching anime on Netflix, and watching music videos on Youtube.

Or I go out to eat some delicious pancakes I found online.
